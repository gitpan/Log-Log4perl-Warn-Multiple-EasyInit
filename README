NAME
    Log::Log4perl::Warn::Multiple::EasyInit - trap multiple calls to
    Log::Log4perl::easy_init

VERSION
    version 0.0.1

SYNOPSIS
      BEGIN {
        use Log::Log4perl::Warn::Multiple::EasyInit;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Have you ever found yourself scratching your head wondering why your
    Log::Log4perl output isn't going to the file(s) you expected?

    Often the culprit is a call to "easy_init()" somewhere in the landscape
    of modules being used.

    You could grep-hunt for the causes, or you could get your scripts and
    modules to keep an eye out for you.

EXPERIMENTAL
    This module is experimental, and possible jsut mental

EXAMPLE
  foo/multiple_init.pl
    This script uses the test libraries for the module:

        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use FindBin::libs;
        use lib "${FindBin::Bin}/../t/lib";
    
        BEGIN {
            use Log::Log4perl::Warn::Multiple::EasyInit;
        }
    
        use foo;
        use bar;
        use baz;
        use quux;

  Script Output
    Slightly reformatted for readability:

        Log::Log4perl already initialised with easy_init()
          [at /tmp/example/script/../t/lib/foo.pm, line 6]
            at /tmp/example/script/../t/lib/bar.pm line 6
        Log::Log4perl already initialised with easy_init()
          [at /tmp/example/script/../t/lib/foo.pm, line 6]
            at /tmp/example/script/../t/lib/quux.pm line 6
        Log::Log4perl already initialised with easy_init()
          [at /tmp/example/script/../t/lib/foo.pm, line 6]
            at /tmp/example/script/../t/lib/baz.pm line 8
